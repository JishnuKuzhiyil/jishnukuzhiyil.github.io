I am a mechanical engineer and researcher pursuing a Ph.D. at Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), University of Warwick. My focus is on mathematical modeling and simulation of dynamic systems, particularly Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). I specialize in grey-box approaches for battery degradation modeling and have a keen interest in universal differential equations. My goal is to contribute to the understanding of dynamic systems and develop innovative methodologies for sustainable energy solutions.
